	X@join Y
	@preinc X
	@rawinc X

@dog:
	Since the `@` character is used to specify preprocessor directives to insert it into the file text, the `@dog` directive was defined.
	Note:
		if you don't want to leave whitespace, add `@` after `@dog`.
	Examples:
		`@dog@preinc "LocalFilePath"` -> `@preinc "LocalFilePath"`
		`@dog@ preinc "LocalFilePath"` -> `@preinc "LocalFilePath"`
		`The @dog symbol is used for text preprocessing` -> `The @ symbol is used for text preprocessing`

X@join Y:
	Used to connect the left and right parts.
	Examples:
		`123@join 456` -> `123456`
		`123@join456` -> ERROR!

@preinc X:
	Include preprocessed text file content.
	Note:
		X - file path, can be enclosed between "" or <>[N/A].
		If the path is enclosed between "", then the file is searched in the folder of the file from which the request was made,
		otherwise[N/A] from the directories passed by the user.
	Examples:
		`@preinc "LocalFilePath"` -> included local file content
		`@preinc <SpecFilePath>` -> [N/A] included file content from specified directories

@rawinc X:
	Include text file content without preprocessing.
	Note:
		X - file path, can be enclosed between "" or <>[N/A].
		If the path is enclosed between "", then the file is searched in the folder of the file from which the request was made,
		otherwise[N/A] from the directories passed by the user.
	Examples:
		`@rawinc "LocalFilePath"` -> included local file content
		`@rawinc <SpecFilePath>` -> [N/A] included file content from specified directories
